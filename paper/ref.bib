  year =          {2004},
  abstract =      {The high eccentricities of the known extrasolar
                   planets remain largely unexplained. We explore the
                   possibility that eccentricities are excited in the
                   outer parts of an extended planetary disk by
                   encounters with stars passing at a few hundred
                   astronomical units. After the encounter, eccentricity
                   disturbances propagate inward because of secular
                   interactions in the disks, eventually exciting the
                   innermost planets. We study how the inward
                   propagation of eccentricity in planetary disks
                   depends on the number and masses of the planets and
                   the spacing between them and on the overall surface
                   density distribution in the disk. The main governing
                   factors are the large-scale surface density
                   distribution and the total size of the system. If the
                   smeared-out surface density is approximated by a
                   power law Sigma(r)~r-q, then eccentricity
                   disturbances propagate inward efficiently for flat
                   density distributions with q<~1. If this condition is
                   satisfied and the size of the planetary system is 50
                   AU or larger, the typical eccentricities excited by
                   this mechanism by field star encounters in the solar
                   neighborhood over 5 Gyr are in the range 0.01-0.1.
                   Higher eccentricities (>0.1) may be excited in
                   planetary systems around stars that are formed in
                   relatively dense, long-lived open clusters.
                   Therefore, this mechanism may provide a natural way
                   to excite the eccentricities of extrasolar planets.},

                   spread in clusters has been hampered by difficulties
                   in obtaining consistent spectroscopic abundances for
                   different stellar types. Without reference to any
                   specific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a
                   homogeneous cluster is that it forms a
                   one-dimensional sequence, with any differences
                   between members due to variations in stellar mass and
                   observational uncertainties. I present a novel method
                   for investigating the abundance spread in open
                   clusters that tests this one-dimensional hypothesis
                   at the level of observed stellar spectra, rather than
                   constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as
                   is traditionally done. Using high-resolution APOGEE
                   spectra for 49 giants in M67, NGC 6819, and NGC 2420
                   I demonstrate that these spectra form one-dimensional
                   sequences for each cluster. With detailed forward
                   modeling of the spectra and Approximate Bayesian
                   Computation, I derive strong limits on the initial
                   abundance spread of 15 elements: <0.01 (0.02) {dex}
                   for C and Fe, ≲0.015 (0.03) {dex} for N, O, Mg, Si,
                   and Ni, ≲0.02 (0.03) {dex} for Al, Ca, and Mn, and
                   ≲0.03 (0.05) {dex} for Na, S, K, Ti, and V (at 68%
                   and 95% confidence, respectively). The strong limits
                   on C and O imply that no pollution by massive
                   core-collapse supernovae occurred during star
                   formation in open clusters, which, thus, need to form
                   within ≲6 {Myr}. Further development of this and
                   related techniques will bring the power of
                   differential abundances to stars other than solar
                   twins in large spectroscopic surveys and will help
                   unravel the history of star formation and chemical
                   enrichment in the Milky Way through chemical
                   tagging.},

  year =          {2011},
  abstract =      {Most of the observed extrasolar planets are found on
                   tight and often eccentric orbits. The high
                   eccentricities are not easily explained by
                   planet-formation models, which predict that planets
                   should be on rather circular orbits. Here we explore
                   whether fly-bys involving planetary systems with
                   properties similar to those of the gas giants in the
                   Solar system can produce planets with properties
                   similar to the observed planets. Using numerical
                   simulations, we show that fly-bys can cause the
                   immediate ejection of planets, and sometimes also
                   lead to the capture of one or more planets by the
                   intruder. More common, however, is that fly-bys only
                   perturb the orbits of planets, sometimes leaving the
                   system in an unstable state. Over time-scales of a
                   few million to several hundred million years after
                   the fly-by, this perturbation can trigger
                   planet-planet scatterings, leading to the ejection of
                   one or more planets. For example, in the case of the
                   four gas giants of the Solar system, the fraction of
                   systems from which at least one planet is ejected
                   more than doubles in 108 yr after the fly-by. The
                   remaining planets are often left on more eccentric
                   orbits, similar to the eccentricities of the observed
                   extrasolar planets. We combine our results of how
                   fly-bys affect Solar-system-like planetary systems,
                   with the rate at which encounters in young stellar
                   clusters occur. For example, we measure the effects
                   of fly-bys on the four gas giants in the Solar
                   system. We find, that for such systems, between 5 and
                   15 per cent suffer ejections of planets in 108 yr
                   after fly-bys in typical open clusters. Thus,
                   encounters in young stellar clusters can
                   significantly alter the properties of any planets
                   orbiting stars in clusters. As a large fraction of
                   stars which populate the solar neighbourhood form in
                   stellar clusters, encounters can significantly affect
                   the properties of the observed extrasolar planets.},

                   in the solar neighbourhood due to gravitational
                   perturbations from passing stars. We include the
                   effects of the Galactic tidal field and continue to
                   follow the stars after they become unbound. For a
                   wide variety of initial semimajor axes and formation
                   times, we find that the number density (stars per
                   unit logarithmic interval in projected separation)
                   exhibits a minimum at a few times the Jacobi radius
                   rJ, which equals 1.7pc for a binary of solar-mass
                   stars. The density peak interior to this minimum
                   arises from the primordial distribution of bound
                   binaries, and the exterior density, which peaks at a
                   separation of ~100-300pc, arises from formerly bound
                   binaries that are slowly drifting apart. The exterior
                   peak gives rise to a significant long-range
                   correlation in the positions and velocities of disc
                   stars that should be detectable in large astrometric

                   angular separations, 3.5"<Deltatheta<900'', whereas
                   the simulated distributions show a break in the power
                   law whose location depends on the MACHO mass and
                   density. This allows us to place upper limits on the
                   density of MACHOs as a function of their assumed
                   mass. At the 95% confidence level, we exclude MACHOs
                   with masses M>43Msolar at the standard local halo

                   modeling to determine Teff, logg, vsini, and [Fe/H]
                   for 1040 FGK-type stars on the Keck, Lick, and
                   Anglo-Australian Telescope planet search programs.
                   This is the first time that a single, uniform
                   spectroscopic analysis has been made for every star
                   on a large Doppler planet search survey. We identify
                   a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations
                   sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with
                   radial velocity semiamplitudes K>30 m s-1 and orbital
                   periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars,
                   we determine that fewer than 3% of stars with
                   -0.5<[Fe/H]<0.0 have Doppler-detected planets. Above
                   solar metallicity, there is a smooth and rapid rise
                   in the fraction of stars with planets. At [Fe/H]>+0.3
                   dex, 25% of observed stars have detected gas giant
                   planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the
                   formation probability for gas giant planets to the
                   square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar
                   metallicity also appears to be correlated with the
                   presence of multiple-planet systems and with the
                   total detected planet mass. This data set was
                   examined to better understand the origin of high
                   metallicity in stars with planets. None of the
                   expected fossil signatures of accretion are observed
                   in stars with planets relative to the general sample:
                   (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the
                   mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2)
                   subgiants with planets do not show dilution of
                   metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si,
                   Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation
                   temperature, and (4) no correlations between
                   metallicity and orbital period or eccentricity could
                   be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar
                   planets do not have an accretion signature that
                   distinguishes them from other stars; more likely,
                   they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular
                   clouds. Based on observations obtained at Lick and

                   stars of planetary systems is confirmed by all recent
                   observations, the reason for this excess is still a
                   subject of debate: is it primordial, or the result of
                   accretion, or both? The basic argument against an
                   accretion origin is related to the mass of the outer
                   convective zones, which varies by more than 1 order
                   of magnitude among the considered stars, while the
                   observed overabundances of metals are similar. We
                   show here that in previous discussions a fundamental
                   process was forgotten: thermohaline convection
                   induced by the inverse mu-gradient. ``Metallic
                   fingers'' might be created that dilute the accreted
                   matter inside the star. Introducing this effect may
                   reconcile the overabundances expected in cases of
                   accretion with the observations of stars of different
                   masses.},

                   investigate the formation of planets and their
                   subsequent evolution. Here, we present a
                   high-precision differential abundance analysis of the
                   XO-2 wide stellar binary based on high-resolution
                   HARPS-N at TNG spectra. Both components are very
                   similar K-dwarfs and host planets. Since they formed
                   presumably within the same molecular cloud, we expect
                   that they possess the same initial elemental
                   abundances. We investigated whether planets can cause
                   some chemical imprints in the stellar atmospheric
                   abundances. We measure abundances of 25 elements for
                   both stars with a range of condensation temperature
                   TC = 40-1741 K, achieving typical precisions of ~0.07
                   dex. The northern component shows abundances in all
                   elements higher by +0.067 $\pm$ 0.032 dex on average,
                   with a mean difference of +0.078 dex for elements
                   with TC > 800 K. The significance of the XO-2N
                   abundance difference relative to XO-2S is at the
                   2sigma level for almost all elements. We discuss that
                   this result might be interpreted as the signature of
                   the ingestion of material by XO-2N or depletion in
                   XO-2S that is due to locking of heavy elements by the
                   planetary companions. We estimate a mass of several
                   tens of M⊕ in heavy elements. The difference in
                   abundances between XO-2N and XO-2S shows a positive
                   correlation with the condensation temperatures of the
                   elements, with a slope of (4.7 $\pm$ 0.9) × 10-5 dex
                   K-1, which could mean that both components have not
                   formed terrestrial planets, but first experienced the

                   refractories are overabundant by up to 0.090 dex. On

                   of AU. To reduce analysis concerns, we selected
                   systems with almost equal mass components. We were
                   able to derive differential abundances of several
                   elements with errors down to 0.01 dex in the best
                   cases. We found that in four systems the two

                   these very severe limits. However, clear differences
                   were found for the two remaining systems (HD 219542

                   appreciable difference for volatile elements and a
                   trend for increasing abundance differences with
                   increasing condensation temperature for individual
                   elements, a result similar to that found for some
                   single stars with planets by Smith et al.
                   (\cite{Smith01}). Finally, we note that HD 219542A
                   has a Li-abundance comparable to those of Li-rich
                   stars in old open clusters, while no Li is detected
                   in the slightly cooler HD 219542B. We suggest that
                   the primaries of these two systems have accreted
                   rocky planets or the inner dust-rich part of a
                   protoplanetary disk, likely due to gravitational

                   primary and secondary stars are identical within the
                   errors: 0.146 $\pm$ 0.014 dex (sigma = 0.033 dex) and
                   0.155 $\pm$ 0.007 dex (sigma = 0.023 dex),
                   respectively. Extremely precise differential
                   abundance ratios of 23 elements have been measured
                   (mean error of sigma([X/Fe]) = 0.013 dex) and are
                   found to be indistinguishable between the two stars:
                   Delta[X/Fe] (secondary - primary) = +0.001 $\pm$
                   0.006 dex (sigma = 0.008 dex). The striking
                   similarity in the chemical composition of the two
                   stellar components in HAT-P-1 is contrary to the
                   possible 0.04 dex level difference seen in 16 Cyg
                   A+B, which also hosts a giant planet, at least three
                   times more massive than the one around HAT-P-1
                   secondary star. We conclude that the presence of
                   giant planets does not necessarily imply differences
                   in the chemical compositions of the host stars. The
                   elemental abundances of each star in HAT-P-1 relative
                   to the Sun show an identical, positive correlation
                   with the condensation temperature of the elements;
                   their abundance patterns are thus very similar to
                   those observed in the majority of solar twins. In
                   view of the Mel{\'e}ndez et al. interpretation of the
                   peculiar solar abundance pattern, we conclude that
                   HAT-P-1 experienced less efficient formation of
                   terrestrial planets than the Sun. This is in line
                   with the expectation that the presence of close-in
                   giant planets preventing the formation or survival of
                   terrestrial planets.},

  abstract =      {Context. Binary systems with similar components are
                   ideal laboratories that allow several physical
                   processes to be tested, such as the possible chemical
                   pattern imprinted by the planet formation process.
                   Aims: We explore the probable chemical signature of
                   planet formation in the remarkable binary system HD
                   80606-HD 80607. The star HD 80606 hosts a giant
                   planet with ~4 MJup detected by both transit and
                   radial velocity techniques, which is one of the most
                   eccentric planets detected to date. We study
                   condensation temperature Tc trends of volatile and
                   refractory element abundances to determine whether
                   there is a depletion of refractories, which could be
                   related to the terrestrial planet formation. Methods:
                   We carried out a high-precision abundance
                   determination in both components of the binary system
                   via a line-by-line, strictly differential approach.
                   First, we used the Sun as a reference and then we
                   used HD 80606. The stellar parameters Teff, log g,
                   [Fe/H] and vturb were determined by imposing
                   differential ionization and excitation equilibrium of
                   Fe I and Fe II lines, with an updated version of the
                   program FUNDPAR, together with plane-parallel local
                   thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) ATLAS9 model
                   atmospheres and the MOOG code. Then, we derived
                   detailed abundances of 24 different species with
                   equivalent widths and spectral synthesis with the
                   program MOOG. The chemical patterns were compared
                   with the solar-twins Tc trends of Mel{\'e}ndez et al.
                   (2009, AJ, 704, L66) and with a sample of
                   solar-analogue stars with [Fe/H] ~ +0.2 dex from
                   Neves et al. (2009, A&A, 497, 563). The Tc trends
                   were also compared mutually between both stars of the
                   binary system. Results: From the study of Tc trends,
                   we concluded that the stars HD 80606 and HD 80607 do
                   not seem to be depleted in refractory elements, which
                   is different for the case of the Sun. Then, following
                   the interpretation of Mel{\'e}ndez et al. (2009), the
                   terrestrial planet formation would have been less
                   efficient in the components of this binary system
                   than in the Sun. The lack of a trend in refractory
                   elements with Tc between both stars implies that the
                   presence of a giant planet do not neccesarily imprint
                   a chemical signature in their host stars, similar to
                   the recent result of Liu et al. (2014, MNRAS, 442,
                   L51). This is also in agreement with Mel{\'e}ndez et
                   al. (2009), who suggest that the presence of close-in
                   giant planets might prevent the formation of
                   terrestrial planets. Finally, we speculate about a
                   possible, ejected or non-detected, planet around the
                   star HD 80607. The data presented herein were
                   obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is

                   elements compared to most solar twins, with the
                   degree of depletion increasing with an element's
                   condensation temperature. Here, I show that adding 4
                   Earth masses of Earth-like and
                   carbonaceous-chondrite-like material to the solar
                   convection zone brings the Sun's composition into
                   line with the mean value for the solar twins. The
                   observed solar composition could have arisen if the
                   Sun's convection zone accreted material from the
                   solar nebula that was depleted in refractory elements
                   due to the formation of the terrestrial planets and
                   ejection of rocky protoplanets from the asteroid
                   belt. Most solar analogs are missing 0-10 Earth
                   masses of rocky material compared to the most
                   refractory-rich stars, providing an upper limit to
                   the mass of rocky terrestrial planets that they
                   possess. The missing mass is correlated with stellar
                   metallicity. This suggests that the efficiency of
                   planetesimal formation increases with stellar
                   metallicity. Stars with and without known giant
                   planets show a similar distribution of abundance
                   trends. If refractory depletion is a signature of the
                   presence of terrestrial planets, this suggests that
                   there is not a strong correlation between the
                   presence of terrestrial and giant planets in the same
                   system.},

                   ingredient in our understanding of the formation,
                   structure, and evolution of both the Sun and our
                   Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential
                   reference standard against which the elemental
                   contents of other astronomical objects are compared.
                   In this review, we evaluate the current understanding
                   of the solar photospheric composition. In particular,
                   we present a redetermination of the abundances of
                   nearly all available elements, using a realistic new
                   three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical
                   model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully
                   considered the atomic input data and selection of
                   spectral lines, and accounted for departures from
                   local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever
                   possible. The end result is a comprehensive and
                   homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental
                   abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are
                   significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne
                   compared to the widely used values of a decade ago.
                   The new solar chemical composition is supported by a
                   high degree of internal consistency between available
                   abundance indicators, and by agreement with values
                   obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most
                   pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark
                   conflict with standard models of the solar interior
                   according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has
                   yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

                   interpreting stellar abundance surveys and
                   understanding galaxy evolution. However, their
                   predictions depend heavily on the treatment of
                   inflow, outflow, star formation efficiency (SFE), the
                   stellar initial mass function, the SN Ia delay time
                   distribution, stellar yields, and stellar population
                   mixing. Using flexCE, a flexible one-zone chemical
                   evolution code, we investigate the effects of and
                   trade-offs between parameters. Two critical
                   parameters are SFE and the outflow mass-loading
                   parameter, which shift the knee in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] and
                   the equilibrium abundances that the simulations
                   asymptotically approach, respectively. One-zone
                   models with simple star formation histories follow
                   narrow tracks in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] unlike the observed
                   bimodality (separate high-alpha and low-alpha
                   sequences) in this plane. A mix of one-zone models
                   with inflow timescale and outflow mass-loading
                   parameter variations, motivated by the inside-out
                   galaxy formation scenario with radial mixing,
                   reproduces the two sequences better than a one-zone
                   model with two infall epochs. We present
                   [X/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks for 20 elements assuming three
                   different supernova yield models and find some
                   significant discrepancies with solar neighborhood
                   observations, especially for elements with strongly
                   metallicity-dependent yields. We apply principal
                   component abundance analysis to the simulations and
                   existing data to reveal the main correlations among
                   abundances and quantify their contributions to
                   variation in abundance space. For the stellar
                   population mixing scenario, the abundances of
                   alpha-elements and elements with
                   metallicity-dependent yields dominate the first and
                   second principal components, respectively, and

                   an important factor in understanding the formation
                   and characteristics of their orbiting planets. The
                   best example of this to date is the
                   planet-metallicity correlation. Other proposed
                   correlations are thus far less robust, in part due to
                   uncertainty in the chemical history of stars pre- and
                   post-planet formation. Binary host stars of similar
                   type present an opportunity to isolate the effects of
                   planets on host star abundances. Here we present a
                   differential elemental abundance analysis of the XO-2
                   stellar binary, in which both G9 stars host giant
                   planets, one of which is transiting. Building on our
                   previous work, we report 16 elemental abundances and
                   compare the Delta(XO-2N-XO-S) values to elemental
                   condensation temperatures. The Delta(N-S) values and
                   slopes with condensation temperature resulting from
                   four different pairs of stellar parameters are
                   compared to explore the effects of changing the
                   relative temperature and gravity of the stars. We
                   find that most of the abundance differences between
                   the stars depend on the chosen stellar parameters,
                   but that Fe, Si, and potentially Ni are consistently
                   enhanced in XO-2N regardless of the chosen stellar
                   parameters. This study emphasizes the power of binary
                   host star abundance analysis for probing the effects
                   of giant planet formation, but also illustrates the
                   potentially large uncertainties in abundance
                   differences and slopes induced by changes in stellar
                   temperature and gravity. Based on data collected at

                   the first to be reported primarily based on data

                   and between the stars themselves, to derive stellar
                   parameters and measure a suite of 21 abundances

                   host stars are old (likely ˜9.5 Gyr) and metal-poor
                   ([Fe/H] ˜ -0.30), and we detect a ˜0.03 dex
                   depletion in refractory elements in HD 133131A versus
                   B (with standard errors ˜0.017). This detection and

                   formation on stellar composition. Assuming that the
                   stars formed in the same environment/from the same
                   material, any compositional anomalies between binary
                   components might indicate differences in how material
                   was sequestered in planets, or accreted by the star
                   in the process of planet formation. We present here a
                   study of the elemental abundance differences between
                   WASP-94A and B, a pair of stars that each host a hot
                   Jupiter exoplanet. The two stars are very similar in
                   spectral type (F8 and F9), and their ˜2700 au
                   separation suggests that their protoplanetary disks
                   were likely not influenced by stellar interactions,
                   but WASP-94Ab's orbit---misaligned with the host star
                   spin axis and likely retrograde---points toward a
                   dynamically active formation mechanism, perhaps
                   different from that of WASP-94Bb, which is not
                   misaligned and has a nearly circular orbit. Based on
                   our high-quality spectra and strictly relative
                   abundance analysis, we detect a depletion of
                   volatiles (˜-0.02 dex, on average) and enhancement
                   of refractories (˜0.01 dex) in WASP-94A relative to
                   B (standard errors are ˜0.005 dex). This is
                   different from every other published case of binary
                   host star abundances, in which either no significant
                   abundance differences are reported or there is some
                   degree of enhancement in all elements, including
                   volatiles. Several scenarios that may explain the
                   abundance trend are discussed, but none can be
                   definitively accepted or rejected. Additional
                   high-contrast imaging observations to search for
                   companions that may be dynamically affecting the
                   system, as well as a larger sample of binary host
                   star studies, are needed to better understand the
                   curious abundance trends we observe in WASP-94A and

  abstract =      {Context. The Sun shows abundance anomalies relative
                   to most solar twins. If the abundance peculiarities
                   are due to the formation of inner rocky planets, that
                   would mean that only a small fraction of solar type
                   stars may host terrestrial planets. Aims: In this
                   work we study HIP 56948, the best solar twin known to
                   date, to determine with an unparalleled precision how
                   similar it is to the Sun in its physical properties,
                   chemical composition and planet architecture. We
                   explore whether the abundances anomalies may be due
                   to pollution from stellar ejecta or to terrestrial
                   planet formation. Methods: We perform a differential
                   abundance analysis (both in LTE and NLTE) using high
                   resolution (R ~ 100 000) high S/N (600-650) Keck
                   HIRES spectra of the Sun (as reflected from the
                   asteroid Ceres) and HIP 56948. We use precise radial
                   velocity data from the McDonald and Keck
                   observatories to search for planets around this star.
                   Results: We achieve a precision of sigma ≲ 0.003
                   dex for several elements. Including errors in stellar
                   parameters the total uncertainty is as low as sigma
                   ~= 0.005 dex (1%), which is unprecedented in
                   elemental abundance studies. The similarities between
                   HIP 56948 and the Sun are astonishing. HIP 56948 is
                   only 17 $\pm$ 7 K hotter than the Sun, and log g,
                   [Fe/H] and microturbulence velocity are only + 0.02
                   $\pm$ 0.02 dex, +0.02 $\pm$ 0.01 dex and +0.01 $\pm$
                   0.01 km s-1 higher than solar, respectively. Our
                   precise stellar parameters and a differential
                   isochrone analysis shows that HIP 56948 has a mass of
                   1.02 $\pm$ 0.02 M&sun; and that it is ~1 Gyr younger
                   than the Sun, as constrained by isochrones,
                   chromospheric activity, Li and rotation. Both stars
                   show a chemical abundance pattern that differs from
                   most solar twins, but the refractory elements (those
                   with condensation temperature Tcond ≳ 1000 K) are
                   slightly (~0.01 dex) more depleted in the Sun than in
                   HIP 56948. The trend with Tcond in differential
                   abundances (twins - HIP 56948) can be reproduced very
                   well by adding ~3 M⊕ of a mix of Earth and

                   Earth/meteoritic mix for the case of hypothetical
                   rocky planets around HIP 56948 is only 0.0047 dex.
                   From our radial velocity monitoring we find no
                   indications of giant planets interior to or within
                   the habitable zone of HIP 56948. Conclusions: We
                   conclude that HIP 56948 is an excellent candidate to
                   host a planetary system like our own, including the
                   possible presence of inner terrestrial planets. Its
                   striking similarity to the Sun and its mature age
                   makes HIP 56948 a prime target in the quest for other
                   Earths and SETI endeavors. Based on observations

                   of old red giant branch (RGB) stars down to ˜1.5 mag

                   limits as low as {mu }V,0˜ 32 mag arcsec-2. The

                   unknown dwarf satellite candidates, of which 9 are
                   confirmed to be at the distance of Cen A (the

                   with Local Group dwarfs but also lie at the
                   faint/diffuse end of their distribution;
                   interestingly, CenA-MM-Dw3 has similar properties to

                   composition and stellar parameters of the solar twin
                   18 Sco in a strictly differential sense relative to
                   the Sun. Our study is mainly based on high-resolution
                   (R ~ 110,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (800-1,000)
                   Very Large Telescope UVES spectra, which allow us to
                   achieve a precision of about 0.005 dex in
                   differential abundances. The effective temperature
                   and surface gravity of 18 Sco are T eff = 5823 $\pm$
                   6 K and log g = 4.45 $\pm$ 0.02 dex, i.e., 18 Sco is
                   46 $\pm$ 6 K hotter than the Sun and log g is 0.01
                   $\pm$ 0.02 dex higher. Its metallicity is [Fe/H] =
                   0.054 $\pm$ 0.005 dex, and its microturbulence
                   velocity is +0.02 $\pm$ 0.01 km s-1 higher than
                   solar. Our precise stellar parameters and
                   differential isochrone analysis show that 18 Sco has
                   a mass of 1.04 $\pm$ 0.02 M &sun; and that it is ~1.6
                   Gyr younger than the Sun. We use precise High
                   Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS)
                   radial velocities to search for planets, but none are
                   detected. The chemical abundance pattern of 18 Sco
                   displays a clear trend with condensation temperature,
                   thus showing higher abundances of refractories in 18
                   Sco than in the Sun. Intriguingly, there are
                   enhancements in the neutron-capture elements relative
                   to the Sun. Despite the small element-to-element
                   abundance differences among nearby n-capture elements
                   (~0.02 dex), we successfully reproduce the r-process
                   pattern in the Solar System. This is independent
                   evidence for the universality of the r process. Our
                   results have important implications for chemical
                   tagging in our Galaxy and nucleosynthesis in general.

                   other contaminants is uncertain, this material most
                   likely accreted from GD 40's circumstellar dust disk
                   whose existence is demonstrated by excess infrared
                   emission. The data are best explained by accretion of
                   rocky planetary material, in which heavy elements are
                   largely contained within oxides, derived from a
                   tidally disrupted minor planet at least the mass of

                   significantly smaller than the ratio near unity for
                   the bulk Earth, chondrites, the Sun, and nearby
                   stars. This result suggests that differentiation

                   differential analysis technique between the
                   components of each pair allows us to reach errors of
                   about 0.02 dex in the iron content difference. Most
                   of the pairs have abundance differences lower than
                   0.02 dex and there are no pairs with differences
                   larger than 0.07 dex. The four cases of differences
                   larger than 0.02 dex may be spurious because of the
                   larger error bars affecting pairs with large
                   temperature difference, cold stars and rotating
                   stars. The pair HD 219542, previously reported by us
                   to have a different composition, here is shown to be
                   normal. For non-rotating stars warmer than 5500 K,
                   characterized by a thinner convective envelope and
                   for which our analyis appears to be of higher
                   accuracy, we are able to exclude in most cases the
                   consumption of more than 1 Earth Mass of iron (about
                   5 Earth masses of meteoritic material) during the
                   main sequence lifetime of the stars, placing more
                   stringent limits (about 0.4 Earth masses of iron) in
                   five cases of warm stars. This latter limit is
                   similar to the estimates of rocky material accreted
                   by the Sun during its main sequence lifetime.
                   Combining the results of the present analysis with
                   those for the Hyades and Pleiades, we conclude that
                   the hypothesis that pollution by planetary material
                   is the only mechanism responsible for the highest
                   metallicity of the stars with planets may be rejected
                   at more than 99% level of confidence if the incidence
                   of planets in these samples is as high as 8% and
                   similar to the field stars included in current radial
                   velocity surveys. However, the significance of this
                   result drops considerably if the incidence of planets
                   around stars in binary systems and clusters is less
                   than a half of that around normal field stars. Based

  abstract =      {Context. More than two thousand exoplanets have been
                   discovered to date. Of these, only a small fraction
                   have been detected around solar twins, which are key
                   stars because we can obtain accurate elemental
                   abundances especially for them, which is crucial for
                   studying the planet-star chemical connection with the
                   highest precision. Aims: We aim to use solar twins to
                   characterise the relationship between planet
                   architecture and stellar chemical composition.
                   Methods: We obtained high-precision (1 m s-1) radial
                   velocities with the HARPS spectrograph on the ESO 3.6
                   m telescope at La Silla Observatory and determined
                   precise stellar elemental abundances ( 0.01 dex)
                   using spectra obtained with the MIKE spectrograph on
                   the Magellan 6.5 m telescope. Results: Our data
                   indicate the presence of a planet with a minimum mass
                   of 26 $\pm$ 4 Earth masses around the solar twin HIP
                   68468. The planet is more massive than Neptune (17
                   Earth masses), but unlike the distant Neptune in our
                   solar system (30 AU), HIP 68468c is close-in, with a
                   semi-major axis of 0.66 AU, similar to that of Venus.
                   The data also suggest the presence of a super-Earth
                   with a minimum mass of 2.9 $\pm$ 0.8 Earth masses at
                   0.03 AU; if the planet is confirmed, it will be the
                   fifth least massive radial velocity planet candidate
                   discovery to date and the first super-Earth around a
                   solar twin. Both isochrones (5.9 $\pm$ 0.4 Gyr) and
                   the abundance ratio [Y/Mg] (6.4 $\pm$ 0.8 Gyr)
                   indicate an age of about 6 billion years. The star is
                   enhanced in refractory elements when compared to the
                   Sun, and the refractory enrichment is even stronger
                   after corrections for Galactic chemical evolution. We
                   determined a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium Li
                   abundance of 1.52 $\pm$ 0.03 dex, which is four times
                   higher than what would be expected for the age of HIP
                   68468. The older age is also supported by the low log
                   () (-5.05) and low jitter (<1 m s-1). Engulfment of a
                   rocky planet of 6 Earth masses can explain the
                   enhancement in both lithium and the refractory
                   elements. Conclusions: The super-Neptune planet
                   candidate is too massive for in situ formation, and
                   therefore its current location is most likely the
                   result of planet migration that could also have
                   driven other planets towards its host star, enhancing
                   thus the abundance of lithium and refractory elements
                   in HIP 68468. The intriguing evidence of planet
                   accretion warrants further observations to verify the
                   existence of the planets that are indicated by our
                   data and to better constrain the nature of the
                   planetary system around this unique star.},

  abstract =      {The discovery of lithium-rich giants contradicts
                   expectations from canonical stellar evolution. Here
                   we report on the serendipitous discovery of 20
                   Li-rich giants observed during the Gaia-ESO Survey,
                   which includes the first nine Li-rich giant stars
                   known towards the CoRoT fields. Most of our Li-rich
                   giants have near-solar metallicities and stellar
                   parameters consistent with being before the
                   luminosity bump. This is difficult to reconcile with
                   deep mixing models proposed to explain lithium
                   enrichment, because these models can only operate at
                   later evolutionary stages: at or past the luminosity
                   bump. In an effort to shed light on the Li-rich
                   phenomenon, we highlight recent evidence of the tidal
                   destruction of close-in hot Jupiters at the sub-giant
                   phase. We note that when coupled with models of
                   planet accretion, the observed destruction of hot
                   Jupiters actually predicts the existence of Li-rich
                   giant stars, and suggests that Li-rich stars should
                   be found early on the giant branch and occur more
                   frequently with increasing metallicity. A
                   comprehensive review of all known Li-rich giant stars
                   reveals that this scenario is consistent with the
                   data. However, more evolved or metal-poor stars are
                   less likely to host close-in giant planets, implying
                   that their Li-rich origin requires an alternative
                   explanation, likely related to mixing scenarios
                   rather than external phenomena.},

                   problem for our understanding of its formation and
                   evolution. It has been suggested that this
                   non-chondritic composition may be explained by
                   collisional erosion of differentiated planetesimals
                   of originally chondritic composition. In this work,
                   we present N-body simulations of terrestrial planet
                   formation that track the growth of planetary embryos
                   from planetesimals. We simulate evolution through the
                   runaway and oligarchic growth phases under the Grand
                   Tack model and in the absence of giant planets. These
                   simulations include a state-of-the-art collision
                   model that allows multiple collision outcomes, such
                   as accretion, erosion, and bouncing events, and
                   enables tracking of the evolving core mass fraction
                   of accreting planetesimals. We show that the embryos
                   grown during this intermediate stage of planet
                   formation exhibit a range of core mass fractions, and
                   that with significant dynamical excitation, enough
                   mantle can be stripped from growing embryos to
                   account for the Earth's non-chondritic Fe/Mg ratio.
                   We also find that there is a large diversity in the
                   composition of remnant planetesimals, with both
                   iron-rich and silicate-rich fragments produced via

                   bulk metallicities. Furthermore, both stars also host
                   giant planets on eccentric orbits with pericenters
                   lsim0.2 AU. Here, we investigate if planets with such
                   orbits could lead to the host stars ingesting
                   material, which in turn may leave similar chemical
                   imprints in their atmospheric abundances. We derived
                   abundances of 15 elements spanning a range of
                   condensation temperature, T C ≈ 40-1660 K. The two
                   stars are found to have a mean element-to-element
                   abundance difference of 0.04 $\pm$ 0.07 dex, which is
                   consistent with both stars having identical bulk
                   metallicities. In addition, for both stars, the
                   refractory elements (T C >900 K) exhibit a positive
                   correlation between abundance (relative to solar) and
                   T C, with similar slopes of ≈1×10-4 dex K-1. The
                   measured positive correlations are not perfect; both
                   stars exhibit a scatter of ≈5×10-5 dex K-1 about
                   the mean trend, and certain elements (Na, Al, Sc) are
                   similarly deviant in both stars. These findings are
                   discussed in the context of models for giant planet
                   migration that predict the accretion of H-depleted
                   rocky material by the host star. We show that a
                   simple simulation of a solar-type star accreting
                   material with Earth-like composition predicts a
                   positive---but imperfect---correlation between
                   refractory elemental abundances and T C. Our measured
                   slopes are consistent with what is predicted for the
                   ingestion of 10-20 Earths by each star in the system.
                   In addition, the specific element-by-element scatter
                   might be used to distinguish between planetary
                   accretion and Galactic chemical evolution scenarios.

  abstract =      {We present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of
                   15 elements in the planet-hosting wide binary (PHWB)
                   system HD 80606+HD 80607 using Keck/HIRES spectra. As
                   in our previous analysis of the PHWB HD 20782+HD
                   20781, we presume that these two G5 dwarf stars
                   formed together and therefore had identical
                   primordial abundances. In this binary, HD 80606 hosts
                   an eccentric (e≈ 0.93) giant planet at ~0.5 AU, but
                   HD 80607 has no detected planets. If close-in giant
                   planets on eccentric orbits are efficient at
                   scattering rocky planetary material into their host
                   stars, then HD 80606 should show evidence of having
                   accreted rocky material while HD 80607 should not.
                   Here we show that the trends of abundance versus
                   element condensation temperature for HD 80606 and HD
                   80607 are statistically indistinguishable,
                   corroborating the recent result of Saffe et al. This
                   could suggest that both stars accreted similar
                   amounts of rocky material; indeed, our model for the
                   chemical signature of rocky planet accretion
                   indicates that HD 80606 could have accreted up to 2.5
                   {M}\oplus of rocky material---about half that
                   contained in the Solar System and primordial asteroid
                   belt---relative to HD 80607 and still be consistent
                   with the data. Since HD 80607 has no known giant
                   planets that might have pushed rocky planet material
                   via migration onto that star, we consider it more
                   likely that HD 80606/07 experienced essentially no
                   rocky planet accretion. This in turn suggests that
                   the migration history of the HD 80606 giant planet
                   must have been such that it ejected any close-in
                   planetary material that might have otherwise been
                   shepherded onto the star.},

  abstract =      {Based on spectra from F and G dwarf stars, we present
                   elemental abundance trends in the Galactic thin and
                   thick disks in the metallicity regime -0.8<˜ [Fe/H]
                   <˜ +0.4. Our findings can be summarized as follows.
                   1) Both the thin and the thick disks show smooth and
                   distinct abundance trends that, at sub-solar
                   metallicities, are clearly separated. 2) For the
                   alpha -elements the thick disk shows signatures of
                   chemical enrichment from SNe type Ia. 3) The age of
                   the thick disk sample is in the mean older than the
                   thin disk sample. 4) Kinematically, there exist thick
                   disk stars with super-solar metallicities. Based on
                   these findings, together with other constraints from
                   the literature, we discuss different formation
                   scenarios for the thick disk. We suggest that the
                   currently most likely formation scenario is a violent
                   merger event or a close encounter with a companion
                   galaxy. Based on kinematics the stellar sample was
                   selected to contain stars with high probabilities of
                   belonging either to the thin or to the thick Galactic
                   disk. The total number of stars are 66 of which 21
                   belong to the thick disk and 45 to the thin disk. The
                   analysis is based on high-resolution spectra with
                   high signal-to-noise (R ~ 48 000 and S/N gtrsim 150,
                   respectively) recorded with the FEROS spectrograph on
                   La Silla, Chile. Abundances have been determined for
                   four alpha -elements (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), for four
                   even-nuclei iron peak elements (Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn),
                   and for the light elements Na and Al, from equivalent
                   width measurements of ~ 30 000 spectral lines. An
                   extensive investigation of the atomic parameters, log
                   gf-values in particular, have been performed in order
                   to achieve abundances that are trustworthy.
                   Noteworthy is that we find for Ti good agreement
                   between the abundances from Ti I and Ti Ii. Our solar
                   Ti abundances are in concordance with the standard
                   meteoritic Ti abundance Based on observations

                   interiors of stars. However, for many elements the
                   exact production sites and the timescales on which
                   they are dispersed into the interstellar medium are
                   unknown. Having a clear picture on the origins of the
                   elements is important for our ability to trace and
                   understand the formation and chemical evolution of
                   the Milky Way and its stellar populations. Aims: The
                   aim of this study is to investigate the origin and
                   evolution of Sc, V, Mn, and Co for a homogeneous and
                   statistically significant sample of stars probing the
                   different populations of the Milky Way, in particular
                   the thin and thick disks. Methods: Using
                   high-resolution spectra obtained with the MIKE,
                   FEROS, SOFIN, FIES, UVES, and HARPS spectrographs, we
                   determine Sc, V, Mn, and Co abundances for a large
                   sample of F and G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood.
                   The method is based on spectral synthesis and using
                   one-dimensional, plane-parallel, local thermodynamic
                   equilibrium (LTE) model stellar atmospheres
                   calculated with the MARCS 2012 code. The non-LTE
                   (NLTE) corrections from the literature were applied
                   to Mn and Co. Results: We find that the abundance
                   trends derived for Sc (594 stars), V (466 stars), and
                   Co (567 stars) are very similar to what has been
                   observed for the alpha-elements in the thin and thick
                   disks. On the contrary, Mn (569 stars) is generally
                   underabundant relative to the Sun (i.e., [ Mn/Fe ] <
                   0) for [ Fe/H ] < 0. In addition, for Mn, when NLTE
                   corrections are applied, the trend changes and is
                   almost flat over the entire metallicity range of the
                   stars in our sample (-2 ≲ [ Fe/H ] ≲ + 0.4). The
                   [Sc/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends show a small
                   separation between the thin and thick disks, while
                   for V and Co they completely overlap. For Mn there is
                   a small difference in [Mn/Fe], but only when NLTE
                   corrections are used. Comparisons with Ti as a
                   reference element show flat trends for all the
                   elements except for Mn that show well separated
                   [Mn/Ti]-[Ti/H] trends for the thin and thick disks.
                   Conclusions: The elements Sc and V present trends
                   compatible with production from type II supernovae
                   (SNII) events. In addition, Sc clearly shows a
                   metallicity dependence for [ Fe/H ] < -1. Instead, Mn
                   is produced in SNII events for [ Fe/H ] ≲ -0.4 and
                   then type Ia supernovae start to produce Mn. Finally,
                   Co appears to be produced mainly in SNII with
                   suggestion of enrichment from hypernovae at low
                   metallicities. This paper includes data gathered with
