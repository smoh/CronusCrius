  abstract =      {The discovery of lithium-rich giants contradicts
                   expectations from canonical stellar evolution. Here
                   we report on the serendipitous discovery of 20
                   Li-rich giants observed during the Gaia-ESO Survey,
                   which includes the first nine Li-rich giant stars
                   known towards the CoRoT fields. Most of our Li-rich
                   giants have near-solar metallicities and stellar
                   parameters consistent with being before the
                   luminosity bump. This is difficult to reconcile with
                   deep mixing models proposed to explain lithium
                   enrichment, because these models can only operate at
                   later evolutionary stages: at or past the luminosity
                   bump. In an effort to shed light on the Li-rich
                   phenomenon, we highlight recent evidence of the tidal
                   destruction of close-in hot Jupiters at the sub-giant
                   phase. We note that when coupled with models of
                   planet accretion, the observed destruction of hot
                   Jupiters actually predicts the existence of Li-rich
                   giant stars, and suggests that Li-rich stars should
                   be found early on the giant branch and occur more
                   frequently with increasing metallicity. A
                   comprehensive review of all known Li-rich giant stars
                   reveals that this scenario is consistent with the
                   data. However, more evolved or metal-poor stars are
                   less likely to host close-in giant planets, implying
                   that their Li-rich origin requires an alternative
                   explanation, likely related to mixing scenarios
                   rather than external phenomena.},

  abstract =      {The Earth appears non-chondritic in its abundances of
                   refractory lithophile elements, posing a significant
                   problem for our understanding of its formation and
                   evolution. It has been suggested that this
                   non-chondritic composition may be explained by
                   collisional erosion of differentiated planetesimals
                   of originally chondritic composition. In this work,
                   we present N-body simulations of terrestrial planet
                   formation that track the growth of planetary embryos
                   from planetesimals. We simulate evolution through the
                   runaway and oligarchic growth phases under the Grand
                   Tack model and in the absence of giant planets. These
                   simulations include a state-of-the-art collision
                   model that allows multiple collision outcomes, such
                   as accretion, erosion, and bouncing events, and
                   enables tracking of the evolving core mass fraction
                   of accreting planetesimals. We show that the embryos
                   grown during this intermediate stage of planet
                   formation exhibit a range of core mass fractions, and
                   that with significant dynamical excitation, enough
                   mantle can be stripped from growing embryos to
                   account for the Earth's non-chondritic Fe/Mg ratio.
                   We also find that there is a large diversity in the
                   composition of remnant planetesimals, with both
                   iron-rich and silicate-rich fragments produced via
                   collisions.},

                   spectra obtained with Magellan/MIKE, we present a
                   detailed chemical abundance analysis of both stars in
                   the planet-hosting wide binary system HD 20782 + HD
                   20781. Both stars are G dwarfs, and presumably
                   coeval, forming in the same molecular cloud.
                   Therefore we expect that they should possess the same
                   bulk metallicities. Furthermore, both stars also host
                   giant planets on eccentric orbits with pericenters
                   lsim0.2 AU. Here, we investigate if planets with such
                   orbits could lead to the host stars ingesting
                   material, which in turn may leave similar chemical
                   imprints in their atmospheric abundances. We derived
                   abundances of 15 elements spanning a range of
                   condensation temperature, T C ≈ 40-1660 K. The two
                   stars are found to have a mean element-to-element
                   abundance difference of 0.04 $\pm$ 0.07 dex, which is
                   consistent with both stars having identical bulk
                   metallicities. In addition, for both stars, the
                   refractory elements (T C >900 K) exhibit a positive
                   correlation between abundance (relative to solar) and
                   T C, with similar slopes of ≈1×10-4 dex K-1. The
                   measured positive correlations are not perfect; both
                   stars exhibit a scatter of ≈5×10-5 dex K-1 about
                   the mean trend, and certain elements (Na, Al, Sc) are
                   similarly deviant in both stars. These findings are
                   discussed in the context of models for giant planet
                   migration that predict the accretion of H-depleted
                   rocky material by the host star. We show that a
                   simple simulation of a solar-type star accreting
                   material with Earth-like composition predicts a
                   positive---but imperfect---correlation between
                   refractory elemental abundances and T C. Our measured
                   slopes are consistent with what is predicted for the
                   ingestion of 10-20 Earths by each star in the system.
                   In addition, the specific element-by-element scatter
                   might be used to distinguish between planetary
                   accretion and Galactic chemical evolution scenarios.

                   15 elements in the planet-hosting wide binary (PHWB)
                   system HD 80606+HD 80607 using Keck/HIRES spectra. As
                   in our previous analysis of the PHWB HD 20782+HD
                   20781, we presume that these two G5 dwarf stars
                   formed together and therefore had identical
                   primordial abundances. In this binary, HD 80606 hosts
                   an eccentric (e≈ 0.93) giant planet at ~0.5 AU, but
                   HD 80607 has no detected planets. If close-in giant
                   planets on eccentric orbits are efficient at
                   scattering rocky planetary material into their host
                   stars, then HD 80606 should show evidence of having
                   accreted rocky material while HD 80607 should not.
                   Here we show that the trends of abundance versus
                   element condensation temperature for HD 80606 and HD
                   80607 are statistically indistinguishable,
                   corroborating the recent result of Saffe et al. This
                   could suggest that both stars accreted similar
                   amounts of rocky material; indeed, our model for the
                   chemical signature of rocky planet accretion
                   indicates that HD 80606 could have accreted up to 2.5
                   {M}\oplus of rocky material---about half that
                   contained in the Solar System and primordial asteroid
                   belt---relative to HD 80607 and still be consistent
                   with the data. Since HD 80607 has no known giant
                   planets that might have pushed rocky planet material
                   via migration onto that star, we consider it more
                   likely that HD 80606/07 experienced essentially no
                   rocky planet accretion. This in turn suggests that
                   the migration history of the HD 80606 giant planet
                   must have been such that it ejected any close-in
                   planetary material that might have otherwise been
                   shepherded onto the star.},

                   <˜ +0.4. Our findings can be summarized as follows.
                   1) Both the thin and the thick disks show smooth and
                   distinct abundance trends that, at sub-solar
                   metallicities, are clearly separated. 2) For the
                   alpha -elements the thick disk shows signatures of
                   chemical enrichment from SNe type Ia. 3) The age of
                   the thick disk sample is in the mean older than the
                   thin disk sample. 4) Kinematically, there exist thick
                   disk stars with super-solar metallicities. Based on
                   these findings, together with other constraints from
                   the literature, we discuss different formation
                   scenarios for the thick disk. We suggest that the
                   currently most likely formation scenario is a violent
                   merger event or a close encounter with a companion
                   galaxy. Based on kinematics the stellar sample was
                   selected to contain stars with high probabilities of
                   belonging either to the thin or to the thick Galactic
                   disk. The total number of stars are 66 of which 21
                   belong to the thick disk and 45 to the thin disk. The
                   analysis is based on high-resolution spectra with
                   high signal-to-noise (R ~ 48 000 and S/N gtrsim 150,
                   respectively) recorded with the FEROS spectrograph on
                   La Silla, Chile. Abundances have been determined for
                   four alpha -elements (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), for four
                   even-nuclei iron peak elements (Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn),
                   and for the light elements Na and Al, from equivalent
                   width measurements of ~ 30 000 spectral lines. An
                   extensive investigation of the atomic parameters, log
                   gf-values in particular, have been performed in order
                   to achieve abundances that are trustworthy.
                   Noteworthy is that we find for Ti good agreement
                   between the abundances from Ti I and Ti Ii. Our solar

  abstract =      {Context. Elements heavier than Li are produced in the
                   interiors of stars. However, for many elements the
                   exact production sites and the timescales on which
                   they are dispersed into the interstellar medium are
                   unknown. Having a clear picture on the origins of the
                   elements is important for our ability to trace and
                   understand the formation and chemical evolution of
                   the Milky Way and its stellar populations. Aims: The
                   aim of this study is to investigate the origin and
                   evolution of Sc, V, Mn, and Co for a homogeneous and
                   statistically significant sample of stars probing the
                   different populations of the Milky Way, in particular
                   the thin and thick disks. Methods: Using
                   high-resolution spectra obtained with the MIKE,
                   FEROS, SOFIN, FIES, UVES, and HARPS spectrographs, we
                   determine Sc, V, Mn, and Co abundances for a large
                   sample of F and G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood.
                   The method is based on spectral synthesis and using
                   one-dimensional, plane-parallel, local thermodynamic
                   equilibrium (LTE) model stellar atmospheres
                   calculated with the MARCS 2012 code. The non-LTE
                   (NLTE) corrections from the literature were applied
                   to Mn and Co. Results: We find that the abundance
                   trends derived for Sc (594 stars), V (466 stars), and
                   Co (567 stars) are very similar to what has been
                   observed for the alpha-elements in the thin and thick
                   disks. On the contrary, Mn (569 stars) is generally
                   underabundant relative to the Sun (i.e., [ Mn/Fe ] <
                   0) for [ Fe/H ] < 0. In addition, for Mn, when NLTE
                   corrections are applied, the trend changes and is
                   almost flat over the entire metallicity range of the
                   stars in our sample (-2 ≲ [ Fe/H ] ≲ + 0.4). The
                   [Sc/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends show a small
                   separation between the thin and thick disks, while
                   for V and Co they completely overlap. For Mn there is
                   a small difference in [Mn/Fe], but only when NLTE
                   corrections are used. Comparisons with Ti as a
                   reference element show flat trends for all the
                   elements except for Mn that show well separated
                   [Mn/Ti]-[Ti/H] trends for the thin and thick disks.
                   Conclusions: The elements Sc and V present trends
                   compatible with production from type II supernovae
                   (SNII) events. In addition, Sc clearly shows a
                   metallicity dependence for [ Fe/H ] < -1. Instead, Mn
                   is produced in SNII events for [ Fe/H ] ≲ -0.4 and
                   then type Ia supernovae start to produce Mn. Finally,
                   Co appears to be produced mainly in SNII with
                   suggestion of enrichment from hypernovae at low
                   metallicities. This paper includes data gathered with
